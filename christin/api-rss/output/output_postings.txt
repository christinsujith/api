In other words Windows VPS is the new VOIP VPS. It is very easy to install and set up a VOIP VPS using a Windows VPS solution in VPS Hosting. Windows VPS is very user-friendly too and is very convenient to use and that is the reason why people prefer setting up a VOIP VPS or a VOIP Server on a Windows VPS. You can set up a VOIP VPS using a Linux VPS also using Asterisk on your Virtual Server. But since a Linux VPS is based on text commands so people prefer it less over a Windows VPS solution. You can set up a VOIP VPS on your Windows Virtual Server using 3cx. 3CX is a phone system that is used on a Windows based virtual server. It is Windows based software that is based on IP PBX. It has the ability to reduce proprietary hardware on PBX \/ PABX. 3CX is SIP standard based and has been designed for Windows based servers only. 3CX is easy to manage and allows its users to use a SIP phone, which can be either hardware or software. 3CX is an IP PBX \/ PABX software and has lots of benefits which are as follows:-    It is easy to manage and install. You can install it and use it using an interface that has web based configuration.-    VOIP VPS using 3CX does not cost much.-    It is very easy to use and you get a call control which is desktop based if you set up your VOIP VPS or VOIP Server using a Windows VPS. -    You do not have to do separate wiring for calling via a phone. -    Your employees can now work from home using the remote extension on VOIP VPS or a VOIP Server -    You also get a choice to choose from a IP hardware or a softphone.-    You can now make calls as well as receive calls by using standard PSTN on your VOIP cards. -    So finally you save lots of money by making monthly calls via your VOIP Server.UCVHOST provides the best VOIP VPS or VOIP Server plans in VPS Hosting (windows vps \/ Linux VPS \/ cheap vps).
