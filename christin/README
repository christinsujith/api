Task
####

Your task is to evaluate different services and there apis/libraries regarding their feasability to be
incorporated into our crawler ecosystem.

The principal steps are the same as you already performed in 
https://team.holzweg.tv/projects/visalyzeexterncrawler/task_lists

Evaluate and document the feasability of the services and provide a small prototype showcasing the api and
libraries (see below).

Please follow the given Template for all your work.

Template
########

Please create a directory for each service and follow this layout:
|- doc.txt
|- credentials.txt
|- legal.txt
|- mapping.txt
|- code/
|  |- lib/
|  |- src/
|- output/
|  |- output_comments.txt
|  |- output_postings.txt
|  |- output_...


Files/Directories
#################

As a general note: please always provide the links to the information/documentation.

doc.txt: general documentation, links to the apis/libraries, general description of extractable information
     with respect to the activitystream format

credentials.txt: all required credentials for the use of the service: username, password, access token, 
    appid, ...

legal.txt: links and information regarding limitations, i.e. rate limits, caching limits, copyright issues,
    ...

mapping.txt: a preliminary/informal mapping of the extractable information to the activitystreams format
    e.g. something like
        'object' candidates are 'data->post', 'data->content', ...
        'actor' candidates are 'data->actor', 'data->resharerers' ...
        'verb' candidates are 'post', 'reshare', 'plus1', ...
        'attachment' candidates for the post are 'data->link', 'data->picture', 'data->like' "
        'target' candidates are...
        and so on

code/: a prototype showcasing the api and the used libraries
|- lib/: the library files (e.g. zend). please make every prototype self contained, i.e. provide all
    necessary libraries in the lib/ folder
|- src/: your prototype code

output/: please provide var_dumps of the extractable information. the files may vary depending on which
    kind of information is extractable.


Organisational
##############

Please document the time you need for the different tasks in the provided christin.xls excel file.
    The table is in german but the format is:
    | Day | Hours |    Task     |
    so for example:
    | 21.02.2012 | 05:30 | Evaluating Tumblr Service |

Also when you complete a task, provide the needed time in the git commit message.

Plan of Action
##############

1. Adapt your earlier Prototypes to the given structure and add possibly missing information.
2. Afterwards work off the given list of additional services in the order they are provided. The list
contains all the services we would be interested in, it is however not expected of you to work off
all the listed services.


Already done (only adaption and missing data needed):
* Google+
* Youtube
* LinkedIn
* Foursquare

Services in prioritized order:
* General RSS ecosystem -> activitystream format
* Many internet forums also provide an RSS feed, so please pick a forum of your choice and evaluate the RSS->activitystream as above
