// In this example, it would be the included callback.php
$callback_url = "http://localhost/api-tumblr/code/src/callback.php";

// Let's begin.  First we need a Request Token.  The request token is required to send the user
// to Tumblr's login page.

// Create a new instance of the TumblrOAuth library.  For this step, all we need to give the library is our
// Consumer Key and Consumer Secret

	// our Callback URL (callback.php) along with some information we need to get
	// an access token.
