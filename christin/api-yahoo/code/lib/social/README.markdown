Requirements
============

The following dependencies are bundled with the Yahoo! PHP SDK, but are under
terms of a separate license. See the bundled LICENSE files for more information:

 * OAuth - http://code.google.com/p/oauth
 * JSON -  http://pear.php.net/Services_JSON


Install
=======

After downloading and unpackaging the release, copy the contents of yosdk/lib
to a directory that is accessible via the PHP require_once method. In
your PHP scripts, require the Yahoo.inc file:

    require_once("Yahoo.inc");

## Debugging with the YOS SDK

The YOS SDK provides some methods that make debugging easier. Also, since the YOS
SDK was designed for the greatest compatibility across PHP version, it is advised
to suppress notices if using PHP 5.x:

    // debug settings
    error_reporting(E_ALL | E_NOTICE); # do not show notices as library is php4 compatable
    ini_set('display_errors', true);

    YahooLogger::setDebug(true);
    YahooLogger::setDebugDestination('LOG');

By default, OAuth credentials (request + access tokens) are stored in PHP sessions.
PHP sessions can easily be configured to work from a local filesystem, a database, or
a memcache instance. The sample apps provide working examples of filesystem storage
and memcache storage.

## Filesystem Session Storage (default)

    // use local filesystem to store oauth credentials via php native sessions
    ini_set('session.save_handler', 'files');
    session_save_path('/tmp/');
    session_start();

## Memcache Session Storage

    // use memcache to store oauth credentials via php native sessions
    ini_set('session.save_handler', 'memcache');
    session_save_path('tcp://localhost:11211?persistent=1&weight=1&timeout=1&retry_interval=15');
    session_start();

## Cookie Based Session Storage (original)

The original default storage backend was based on storing access tokens in a plain text cookie. This is bad for security, and the default has since been changed (breaks backwards compatibility). In order to use the original
session store, you must instantiate 'CookieSessionStore' and pass into all methods of YahooSession:

    $sessionStore = new CookieSessionStore();

    YahooSession::hasSession($consumerKey, $consumerSecret, $applicationId, $sessionStore, $verifier)
    YahooSession::requireSession($consumerKey, $consumerSecret, $applicationId, $callback, $sessionStore, $verifier)
    YahooSession::initSession($consumerKey, $consumerSecret, $applicationId, $redirect, $callback, $sessionStore, $verifier)

    YahooSession::createAuthorizationUrl($consumerKey, $consumerSecret, $callback, $sessionStore)
    YahooSession::redirectForAuthorization($consumerKey, $consumerSecret, $callback, $sessionStore)
    YahooSession::clearSession($sessionStore)
    YahooSession::checkSession($sessionType, $sessionStore)


Examples
========

In the yosdk/sample directory you'll find sampleapp.php, a sample application
that will get you started. Put the file in your hosting directory and fill
in the consumer key, consumer key secret and application ID. When you're done,
point your browser at the URL. You will be directed to verify access to the
application and then you will be redirected back to your application.

In the yosdk/sample directory you'll find delicious.php, a sample yahoo open
application that shows how to use YQL to make web service request.

Make sure to update the OAuth credentials in each bundled example:

    define('OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY', '###');
    define('OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET', '###');
    define('OAUTH_DOMAIN', '###');
    define('OAUTH_APP_ID', '###');


## Fetching YQL:

    $session = YahooSession::requireSession(OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY, OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET, OAUTH_APP_ID);
    $user = $session->getSessionedUser();

    var_dump($session->query('select * from social.connections where owner_guid=me'));


## Fetching Social Data:

    $session = YahooSession::requireSession(OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY, OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET, OAUTH_APP_ID);
    $user = $session->getSessionedUser();

    var_dump($user->getProfile());
    var_dump($user->getContacts());


## Setting YAP Small View:

    $session = YahooSession::requireSession(OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY, OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET, OAUTH_APP_ID);
    $user = $session->getSessionedUser();

    $content = '<h1><yml:name> customized small view</h1>';
    var_dump($user->setSmallView($content));


## Adding a Contact:
    
    $contact_fields = array();
    $contact_fields[] = array('type' => 'email', 'value' => 'me@domain.com');
    $contact_fields[] = array('type' => 'name', 'value' => array('givenName'=> 'John', 'familyName' => 'Doe'));
    $contact = array('fields' => $contact_fields);

    var_dump($user->addContact($contact));

Tests
=====

The Yahoo! PHP SDK comes with a test suite to validate functionality. The tests also
show functional examples and results. To run the test suite, simply execute the test suite:

    php phpunit test/OAuthTest.php
