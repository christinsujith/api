And your solution, to make sure we don't have corrupt politicians in office, is to not exercise *any* of our democratic rights? So what happens when nobody but the politicians themselves even vote anymore?  How are we supposed to get them out of office then?  How would democracy even function **if people don't vote**?  I don't get this rational of "THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN, OUR POLITICIANS ARE ALL BOUGHT AND CORRUPT!  LETS NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT EXCEPT BITCH AND MOAN AND MAYBE ONE DAY WE'LL ALL SPONTANEOUSLY RISE UP AND HAVE A REVOLUTION Maaaaan.  And then, like, we'll be in a Utopian society where nobody ever tries to vote to change things, and everything will be perfect."

There's a reason super PACs exist, along with other special interest groups and corporations that pump fiat into the political system. Russia has had turnouts of 100% (WINK), yet oligarchs still have a firm grasp on wealth, resources and political power.

I pretty much just read everything that looked interesting (everything but the Yes Men/Bhopal stuff) and there isn't too much there yet, but there are a couple that are very very interesting.

For example, [this one](http://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/185945_re-alpha-s3-g3-israel-iran-barak-hails-munitions-blast-in.html) deals with a supposed "confirmed israeli intelligence agent" and the run up to war with Iran and the agent's alleged knowledge on the matter.  I'm pretty uncomfortable posting this one, but hey, it's already out there and it's just one source, so we don't really don't know how accurate it is.

EDIT: I'd also add that StratFor seems to be a bunch of well-connected dumbasses, so for all I know they're being misled.

Sexual is merely one in a tool box. Frequently the sexual manipulation is in two major forms: sexual favors and black mail. Sexual favors would be is the person is a nymphomaniac (Clinton) or if the person has a proclivity for a particular type of sexual experience - especially deviant as it is more difficult to procure and thus has fewer avenues for expression. The blackmail is much easier. For example, if the person is a homosexual this can be very easily exploited if the person happens to be a political figure. 

Different tools for different people. If one cannot manipulate through sexual means one simply finds an alternative. The person might be a compulsive gambler. The person might be a niave altruist. If the goal is manipulation then all the manipulator will do is scope the subject and find the angle. Everyone has a weakness to be exploited. 

As for Assange, I don't know enough to speculate. It would not surprise me if the charges are bullshit. Character assassination is common these days. All one needs do is say 'rape' or 'molestation' so that the public dismisses everything that person says. You can kill as many people as you like; but God help you if you if someone claims - true or not - that you're done something sexually reprehensible.

This is why I try not to judge. Time will tell.

If I was head of the CIA/NSA etc, and I knew my organization was doing insane, fucked up, completely illegal shit that would have the American people in an actual uproar, I'd "leak" mundane bullshit to keep people occupied and make them feel satisfied that they have an idea of what's really going on so they don't go digging too much and just feel that some of the smartest people in the country (it's pretty damn hard to get in the CIA) are apparently just incompetent baboons.  

I mean, most intelligence organizations have some history of doing some stuff that is completely bugger insane, and that's just stuff that we know about or even gets declassified.  Just look at stuff like MKULTRA.  Also look at how they burned so many records of it, and get away with that...  There's got to be a good chance there's some truly fucked up things that are kept much better secret, with fewer people "in the know" and worth throwing out smoke screens for.

I also find it hard to believe that wikileaks would really still exist if the US government was truly concerned about their secrets being released and wanted it dead.

If I was head of the CIA/NSA etc, and I knew my organization was doing insane, fucked up, completely illegal shit that would have the American people in an actual uproar, I&#39;d &quot;leak&quot; mundane bullshit to keep people occupied and make them feel satisfied that they have an idea of what&#39;s really going on so they don&#39;t go digging too much and just feel that some of the smartest people in the country (it&#39;s pretty damn hard to get in the CIA) are apparently just incompetent baboons.  </p>

<p>I mean, most intelligence organizations have some history of doing some stuff that is completely bugger insane, and that&#39;s just stuff that we know about or even gets declassified.  Just look at stuff like MKULTRA.  Also look at how they burned so many records of it, and get away with that...

Analysis
That part of the craft of intelligence which concerns itself with collating and understanding the information that has been delivered from all sources.  Analysts sit on their dead asses all day long thinking deep thoughts.  They know too much to risk in the field, plus they are too dumb to know when to duck.

ATF
Alcohol Tobacco and Fire Arms.  Rednecks with a license to kill.  Never, ever, ever ask for their help on anything.

Background Check
Check of history of someone to determine reliability.  Usually meaningless.  A perfect credit rating does not mean you arenâ€™t devious scum.  Does run up the clientâ€™s bill and makes it appear that you are busy. Clancy move.  Pros run tests.

BYM
Bright Young Man.  Doesnâ€™t know shit. Doesnâ€™t know that he doesnâ€™t know.  Likely to burn you the first time out.  Try to get him killed as quickly as possible.

Circle Jerk
Analystâ€™s Disease.  â€œAâ€ releases a bit of dubious information.  â€œBâ€ reads the claim and puts it in his report.  â€œAâ€ reads the information in Bâ€™s report and decides that his information may actually be true.  â€œCâ€ picks up â€œAâ€™sâ€ and â€œBâ€™sâ€ reports and expands on it creatively.  â€œAâ€ and â€œBâ€ now both believe their original piece of bullshit is absolutely true.  Actually, thereâ€™s not a word of truth to any of it.  ITâ€™S A CIRCLE JERK.

Bright Young Man.  Doesnâ€™t know shit. Doesnâ€™t know that he doesnâ€™t know.  Likely to burn you the first time out.  Try to get him killed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Circle Jerk
Analystâ€™s Disease.  â€œAâ€ releases a bit of dubious information.  â€œBâ€ reads the claim and puts it in his report.  â€œAâ€ reads the information in Bâ€™s report and decides that his information may actually be true.  â€œCâ€ picks up â€œAâ€™sâ€ and â€œBâ€™sâ€ reports and expands on it creatively.  â€œAâ€ and â€œBâ€ now both believe their original piece of bullshit is absolutely true.  Actually, thereâ€™s not a word of truth to any of it.  ITâ€™S A CIRCLE JERK.</p>

That's quite a different question, isn't it?

Aliens coming and tinkering with existing primates to create us is absolutely a possibility, and one that is above creationism in terms of probability. WAY above creationism, since it merely requires a space travelling entity that can splice genes. We're almost there ourselves! 

The OP's theory: aliens coming to earth, killing Neanderthals off, and forgetting they are aliens (and "becoming" us) is essentially 100% impossible.

To me it made them seem biased and untrustworthy.  It is better if they remain neutral and simply provide the facts.  There are billions of other people on the planet who can parse threw it and provide their analysis.  If someone from wiki leaks wants to do that, they should do it through another venue; instead of turning wiki leaks into another cnn or fox news.

Most of the juicy stuff in USA and around the world happens not in the government but inside private corporations and other private entities.

I definitely disagree with those who are disappointed ahead of time just from hearing the name "Stratfor."  It might be disappointing, but let's wait for the actual information before we get disappointed.
