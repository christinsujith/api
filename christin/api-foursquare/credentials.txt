firstly we need to https://foursquare.com/oauth/ and here we should register our application by creating a new consumer

once its created, it gives us the Client ID and Client SECRET code. this are important which we need in the scripts

and most importantly we need to generate the authoristaion token which helps us retrieving the content from foursquare, for doing this we can run the script tokenrequest.php. which gives us the token code. and we need to pass that in the respective variable in the code.

        // Set your client key and secret
        $client_key = "10KUVECURKCQ4LSOTSZPS3U0ZUB5RBJB4FALVSLD4TPEMI35";
        $client_secret = "DBJOAI2BP53JKZW00UTOCUYHGEAAGV0UNBNDRAYJ05CRJCDC";
        // Set your auth token, loaded using the workflow described in tokenrequest.php
        $auth_token = "Q5QX5D4KK1TXZUUT5QK3PGUMXTTV5D5GUFD0JZILFL4SRYD5";
