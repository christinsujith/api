Don 2 - The Chase Continues is an upcoming Hindi action thriller film directed by Farhan Akhtar. It is the sequel to the 2006 hit film, Don: The Chase Begins Again, which itself is a remake of the cult 1978 blockbuster film Don, therefore making it the first sequel to a remake in Bollywood history. The film has Shahrukh Khan (as the title character), Priyanka Chopra, Boman Irani and Om Puri, reprising their roles from the previous film; with Lara Dutta, Kunal Kapoor. It has been reported that Arjun Rampal will not be reprising his role in the sequel. 

Production

The idea for a sequel has been conceptualized ever since the first movie was released, and a sequel was announced by Farhan Akhtar shortly after the release. However, he was involved with other commitments while Shahrukh Khan also gave his dates to the movies Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi and My Name Is Khan. Recently, however, Akhtar revealed that the script and locations for the movie has been finalized.Shooting for Don 2 will begin from October 10, 2010 in Berlin, Germany.

Rights

Reliance Big Pictures has bought the rights of Don 2 from Excel Entertainment for reportedly Rs 125 crore. The price has yet to be confirmed. It's thought that Reliance Big Pictures bought the rights for Don 2 along with other upcoming films from Excel Entertainment in a multi-film deal."
